NetbeansApplications
====================

Project I have done in Java via netbeans 
1. Mortgage App
A mortgage is basically a loan which is used by purchasers of real property to raise money to buy the property to be purchased or by existing property owners to raise funds for any purpose. This application should be used to calculate how long it would take to pay for a fixed rate mortgage.  I am using this equcation. https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/e/b/5ebd4c9108be3d617a8b1cb02efeb4e4.png
